            Zakir Abdul Karim Naik (born 18 October 1965) is an Indian Islamic public orator who focuses on comparative religion.[10] He is the founder and president of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) and the Peace TV Network. He is a well-known figure in the Islamic world, and while he does not claim to be a follower of any one school of thought in Islam, he is most closely associated with the Salafi school of thought.[11][12]

Naik is currently a wanted fugitive in India, where, in 2016, the authorities charged Naik for money laundering while he was abroad in Malaysia; Naik did not return to India and became a permanent resident of Malaysia.[13][14][15] Naik denies all charges. The National Investigation Agency unsuccessfully attempted to issue an Interpol red notice for his arrest, due to insufficient evidence.[16][17] Peace TV is banned in India, Bangladesh, Canada, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom.[18][19][20]

Early life and education
Zakir Naik was born on 18 October 1965 to Abdul Karim Naik and Roshan Naik in Bombay, India. He attended Kishinchand Chellaram College and studied medicine at the Topiwala National Medical College & BYL Nair Charitable Hospital and later the University of Mumbai, where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS).[21]

Career
In 1991 he started working in the field of dawah and founded the Islamic International School in Mumbai and the United Islamic Aid, which provides scholarships to poor and destitute Muslim youth.[22] Naik's wife, Farhat Naik, is the president of the women's section of the Islamic Research Foundation (IRF).[3][23] He established United Islamic Aid, which provides scholarship to poor and destitute Muslim youth.[2]

Naik said in 2006 that he was inspired by Ahmed Deedat, an Islamic preacher whom he met in 1987.[24] (Naik is sometimes referred to as "Deedat plus", a label given to him by Deedat.)[24][25]

On 21 January 2006, the Islamic Research Foundation, which Naik heads, founded Peace TV. It is a non-profit Emirati satellite television network that broadcasts free-to-air programming. It is one of the world's largest religious satellite television networks.[26][27]

In the second half of March 2021, Naik launched Al Hidaayah, which provides educational content about Islam. The platform has thousands of hours of videos of more than 40 renowned Islamic speakers from all over the world including Ahmed Deedat, Yusuf Estes, Hussein Ye, and Bilal Philips. He claimed that this platform is a "halal" version of Netflix.[28][29]

Lectures and debates
Unlike many Islamic preachers, his lectures are colloquial,[30] given in English, not Urdu or Arabic,[31] and he usually wears a suit and tie.[30] Naik has held many debates and lectures[1][4][32] and is said to "have delivered over 4000[33] lectures around the world" as of 2016. Anthropologist Thomas Blom Hansen has written that Naik's style of memorising the Quran and Hadith literature in various languages, and his related missionary activity, has made him extremely popular in Muslim circles.[34] Many of his debates are recorded and widely distributed in video and DVD media and online. His talks have been recorded in English and broadcast on weekends on several cable networks in Mumbai's Muslim neighbourhoods, and on the Peace TV channel, which he co-produces.[35][36] Topics he speaks on include: "Islam and Modern Science", "Islam and Christianity", and "Islam and secularism".

His first debate was in 1994, a debate on the views of writer Taslima Nasreen on Islam in her book Lajja, organised at the "Mumbai Marathi Patrakar Sangh", entitled "Is Religious Fundamentalism a Stumbling block to Freedom of Expression?".[37] With the presence of four journalists, the debate went on for hours.[37] In April 2000, Naik debated with William Campbell in Chicago on the topic of "The Qur'an and the Bible: In the Light of Science", one of his most-cited debates.[38] On 21 January 2006 Naik held an inter-religious dialogue with Ravi Shankar in Bangalore about the concept of God in Islam and Hinduism.[39] In February 2011 Naik addressed the Oxford Union via video link from India.[40]

University of Melbourne
In 2004 Naik, at the invitation of the Islamic Information and Services Network of Australasia, made an appearance at the University of Melbourne, where he argued that only Islam gave women true equality.[41] He said the more "revealing Western dress" makes women more susceptible to rape.[42] Sushi Das of The Age commented that "Naik extolled the moral and spiritual superiority of Islam and lampooned other faiths and the West in general", further stating that Naik's words "fostered a spirit of separateness and reinforced prejudice".[43]


Naik delivered four lectures in Malaysia during 2012. The lectures took place in Johor Bahru, Universiti Teknologi MARA in Shah Alam,[48] Kuantan and Putra World Trade Centre in Kuala Lumpur. The former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, prominent figures and several thousand people attended the lectures at different places despite protest by the members of HINDRAF.[49] The organisers of Naik's speeches said their purpose was to promote harmony among
